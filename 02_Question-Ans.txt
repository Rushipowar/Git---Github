The Git workflow is a process that developers follow when using Git, a distributed version control system, to manage 
their source code. 

1. Working Directory:-
       - The working directory is your local file system where you store and edit your project's files. This directory 
       contains all your project's files and directories. make changes in working directory like delete, edit, create.
       - git monitor working directory but changes are not automatically include.

2. Staging Area:-
       - Staging area is an intermediate area where you prepare and select changes to be included in the next commit.
       - To stage changes for a commit, you use the git add command to move specific files or changes from the working 
       directory to the staging area.
       - The staging area allows you to review your changes, make sure they are correctly organized.

3. Repository:- 
       - In git repository stores the complete history of your project, including all committed changes.
       - When you're ready to save your changes as a permanent part of the project's history, you commit them 
       to the repository using the git commit command.
       - The repository allows you to access the full history of the project, collaborate with others, and share your code.
