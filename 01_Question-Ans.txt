Version control, also known as source control it is a system that manages changes to code, or any set of files 
over time. It helps track and organize files and providing a historical record of what changes were made, who made 
them, when they were made, and why they were made.

Reasons:
    1. Collaboration:-  
    Version control systems allow developers to collaborate effectively by providing 
    a way to merge their changes, resolve conflicts, and ensure that the final codebase remains stable and functional.

    2. History and Accountability:- 
    Version control systems maintain a complete history of changes made to the code. 
    This historical record helps developers understand how the code has evolved over time and allows 
    them to when and why specific changes were made.

    3. Documentation:- 
    Version control systems can include commit messages and comments, which serve as a 
    form of documentation for the changes made to the code. 
    
    4. Branching and Forking:-
     Developers can create branches to work on new features, experiments, or 
    bug fixes independently. forking a repository is a common way to start a new project based on an existing one.
