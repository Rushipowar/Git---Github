GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaborative software development. It allows individuals and 
teams to work on software projects, track changes, and coordinate their efforts. 

1. Version Control:-
 GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code over time. This allows developers 
 to work on different aspects of a project concurrently, make changes, and merge them together while preserving a 
 complete history of revisions.

2. Code Hosting:-
 GitHub serves as a hosting platform for software repositories. It enables developers to store, share, and distribute 
 their code with others. This makes it a central hub for open-source and private projects.

3. Collaboration:-
 GitHub provides tools for collaboration such as pull requests, issues, and project boards. Developers can propose 
 changes, discuss them, and review each other's code. This fosters collaboration among team members, making it easier 
 to work on software projects collectively.

4. Documentation:-
 GitHub supports documentation making it easier to create and maintain project documentation, contributing 
 guidelines, and more.
